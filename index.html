<h1 id="helm-service-base">The Microservice Helm Library for Kubernetes</h1>
<p>This is a Helm chart library that provides a set of reusable templates and functions to help you create and manage microservices on Kubernetes. It includes common configurations for deployments, services, ingress, and other Kubernetes resources.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Usage as a Dependency</h2>
    <p>
        This chart is intended to be consumed as a library dependency by application charts. Below are recommended ways to embed and use it.
    </p>
    <h3>Add as a dependency in your application's <code>Chart.yaml</code> (Helm v3):</h3>
    <pre><code>dependencies:
  - name: helm-service-base
    alias: base-service
    version: 0.0.5
    repository: "https://vlnrajesh.github.io/helm-service-base" # optional for published repos
</code></pre>
    <h3>Local development: use a local path in your application's <code>Chart.yaml</code> or use <code>helm dependency</code> commands.</h3>
    <p>Local path example (useful for testing changes in the library chart):</p>
    <pre><code>dependencies:
  - name: helm-service-base
    alias: base-service
    version: 0.0.3
    repository: "file://../helm-service-base"
</code></pre>
